Employee Management REST API with Spring Boot and MongoDB
This project is a simple Employee Management web application built using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data MongoDB. It provides RESTful endpoints for storing and retrieving employee details, such as Employee ID, Name, Email, and Location.
